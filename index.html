        The Nobel Peace Prize (Swedish and Norwegian: Nobels fredspris) is one
        of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Swedish
        industrialist, inventor and armaments (military weapons and equipment)
        manufacturer Alfred Nobel, along with the prizes in Chemistry, Physics,
        Physiology or Medicine and Literature. Since March 1901, it has been
        awarded annually (with some exceptions) to those who have "done the most
        or the best work for fraternity between nations, for the abolition or
        reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace
        congresses".

        The prize ceremonies take place annually. Each recipient, known as a
        laureate, receives a green gold medal plated with 24 karat gold, a
        diploma, and a monetary award. As of 2023, the Nobel Prize monetary
        award is 11,000,000 SEK. (1,061,846 USD)[3] A prize may not be shared
        among more than three individuals, although the Nobel Peace Prize can be
        awarded to organisations of more than three people. Nobel Prizes are not
        awarded posthumously, but if a person is awarded a prize and dies before
        receiving it, the prize is presented

        Nobel died in 1896 and he did not leave an explanation for choosing
        peace as a prize category. As he was a trained chemical engineer, the
        categories for chemistry and physics were obvious choices. The reasoning
        behind the peace prize is less clear. According to the Norwegian Nobel
        Committee, his friendship with Bertha von Suttner, a peace activist and
        later recipient of the prize, profoundly influenced his decision to
        include peace as a category.
